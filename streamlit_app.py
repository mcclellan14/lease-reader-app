- Effective Date
- Landlord
- Tenant
- Leased Premises (unit numbers, e.g., 13, 14)
- Leased Premises Address
- Square Footage (sum if more than one unit, numbers only, no labels like "sq. ft.")
- Security Deposit
- Possession Date
- Commencement Date
- Term (Years)
- Minimum Rent Year 1 to Year 10 (in $/sf, calculated from total square footage)
- Renewal Option
- Permitted Use
- Insurance Requirement
- Fixturing Period
- Signage Rent
- Parking Rent
- Right of First Refusal

Return exactly one row as a Python list. Each field must be wrapped in double quotes to prevent commas from splitting fields.

Use consistent formatting:
- All dates must be written as 'Month D, YYYY' (e.g., June 1, 2025)
- Minimum Rent values must be formatted as dollar amounts, e.g., $19.00
- Lease terms must be expressed as numbers (e.g., 5 not "FIVE")
- Leased Premises must be described by unit name/number, not just a count

If the lease is shorter than 10 years, leave the remaining minimum rent year fields as empty strings ("").
Do not include any explanation before or after the list.

Order: Effective Date, Landlord, Tenant, Leased Premises, Leased Premises Address, Square Footage, Security Deposit, Possession Date, Commencement Date, Term (Years), Minimum Rent Year 1 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 2 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 3 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 4 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 5 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 6 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 7 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 8 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 9 ($/sf), Minimum Rent Year 10 ($/sf), Renewal Option, Permitted Use, Insurance Requirement, Fixturing Period, Signage Rent, Parking Rent, Right of First Refusal
